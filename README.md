## Overview:

Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hoboken, New Jersey.  It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and itâ€™s a fun and affordable way to get around town.  There is a need to analyze trip data using data from August of 2019 to see what observations we can conclude.
