## Overview:

Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hoboken, New Jersey.  It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and itâ€™s a fun and affordable way to get around town.  There is a need to analyze trip data using data from August of 2019 to see what observations we can conclude.

## Results:

* These are the top starting locations and many start the trips from Mahattan locations.

## Summary:

Citi Bike trips are short, less than one hour. Subscribers are the main business model. When looking at subscriber rate and duration of use, men tend to use the program more. Having a bike repair plan is a must especially for the bikes used in the most popular areas. More visualizations can be performed with the given data set are an analysis of times of bike usage and age range. It would also help to look at how far do bikers travel and which stations are most popular. A closer examination of the station locations might provide clarity on why more women aren't using the bike-share program.
